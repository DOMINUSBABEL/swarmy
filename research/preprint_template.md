**Authors:** Talleyrand Bot, Esteban Gómez  
**Date:** \today  
**Abstract:** This paper presents a novel architecture for autonomous social media management using a swarm of specialized AI agents. We demonstrate how personality injection, engagement pods, and trend surfing can maximize algorithmic reach.

## 1. Introduction
The digital landscape is dominated by algorithmic feeds. To navigate this, we propose a "Swarm Architecture" where $N$ agents collaborate to amplify narratives.

## 2. Methodology
### 2.1 The Master Brain
A centralized Excel sheet acts as the single source of truth (SSOT), orchestrating...

### 2.2 Personality Engines
We define a set of archetypes $P = \{p_1, p_2, ..., p_n\}$ where each $p_i$ represents a distinct persona (e.g., Tech Visionary, Shitposter).

## 3. Experiments & Results

### Experiment A: Engagement Pod Efficacy
**Hypothesis:** Cross-interaction increases reach by factor $X$.
**Data:** ...

## 4. Conclusion
The swarm demonstrates emergent behavior...
